## Quick Fixes

### "I'm scared of the terminal!"
â†’ Download [Warp Terminal](https://www.warp.dev/terminal) - it has AI that helps you with commands!

### "Command not found: npm"
â†’ Install Node.js from https://nodejs.org (download LTS version)

### "API key not found"
1. Get key from https://aistudio.google.com/prompts/new_chat
2. Edit `.env` file: `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY=your_key_here`

### "Permission denied"
â†’ Try adding `sudo` before the command (Mac/Linux)

### "Can't find the project folder"
â†’ Use `cd Desktop/ai-market-research-tool` (or wherever you extracted it)

### "PDF not generated" or "Taking too long"
â†’ Check internet connection
â†’ Try reducing depth to "quick" or "standard"  
â†’ Executive reports take 15-25 minutes - be patient!
